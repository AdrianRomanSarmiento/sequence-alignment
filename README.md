# sequence-alignment
Common algorithms for two sequences alignments


## Needleman-Wunsch algorithm

Finds the **optimal global alignment** between two sequences using dynamic programmig. Provides an exact solution for the chosen score.

Input: two sequences and a scoring system

Output: the optimal global alignment, its score and the scoring and pointers matrices.


## Smith-Waterman algorithm

Finds the **optimal local alignment** between two sequences using dynamic programmig. Provides an exact solution for the chosen score.

Input: two sequences and a scoring system

Output: the optimal local alignment, its score and the scoring and pointers matrices.
