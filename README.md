# sequence-alignment
Common algorithms for two sequences alignment


#Needleman-Wunsch algorithm
  Finds the optimal global alignment between two sequences using dynamic programmig. Provides an exact solution for the chosen score.
  Input: two sequences and a scoring system
  Output: the optimal alignment, its score and the scoring and pointers matrices.
